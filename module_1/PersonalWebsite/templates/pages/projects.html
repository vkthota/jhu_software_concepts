    <p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on:</p>

    <article class="project-item">
        <h3>Module 1: Personal Website</h3>
        <div class="project-details">
            <p>This project involved the development of my personal developer portfolio â€“ the very website you are currently browsing. The primary objective was to apply fundamental website construction principles and create a dynamic online presence to showcase my biography, technical skills, completed modules, and other Python projects.</p>
            <p>I utilized Flask, a Python-based micro web framework, to handle the backend logic and routing. The front-end was structured with HTML and styled using CSS to ensure a clean, responsive, and user-friendly experience. Key features of this website include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A comprehensive biography and skills overview.</li>
                <li>A dedicated section to display my projects (including this one).</li>
                <li>Contact information and links to relevant professional profiles.</li>
            </ul>
